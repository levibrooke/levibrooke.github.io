For a few months I had been thinking about redesigning my website. Doing so became much more important when I started looking for a new job. I had some ideas for the new site but also a lot of unanswered questions.

My previous site was completely static and lacked any ability for me to blog - something I wanted to have with the new site. But after some previous experience with Wordpress, I thought I might want to go in a different direction.

After some thought I came up with three main requirements for the project:
1. I wanted something clean and simple that would focus on content.
2. I didnâ€™t want to use a bloated CMS like Wordpress.
3. I wanted to learn something new in the process.

Doing some reading online led me to Jekyll, a static site generator. Jekyll allows you to serve static files to build your website and includes blog functionality with no database needed. Because of this, Jekyll sites are fast.

Perhaps my favorite thing about building with Jekyll is templating with Liquid. As someone who never really enjoyed working in PHP to build Wordpress themes, this was a welcome change.

After I started building the new website I stumbled upon (Siteleaf)[http://siteleaf.com]. Siteleaf is really cool because of it's simplicity and ease of use.
