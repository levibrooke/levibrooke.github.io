            <p>I enjoy collaborating with other people to bring creative ideas to life. I excel in focusing on the details that lead to the successful execution of a project and I'm constantly pushing myself to learn new skills.</p>
            <p>While my education was in public relations, I spend most of my time working on websites and digital strategy. Lately, I've been building static websites with Jekyll and learning tools like SASS and Git.</p>
