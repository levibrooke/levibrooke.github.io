        <p>Hi, my name is Levi Porter. I'm a digital strategist and freelancer currently based in Honolulu, Hawaii. I moved to Hawaii this year from Jacksonville, Florida where I went to school and served in the Coast Guard.</p>
        <p><img class="img-responsive alignleft" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/beach.jpg" style="max-width: 450px;">I like learning about the web and how people are making websites, products and other tools. To better explore some of these iterests, I've built this site to write about my experiences and try out what I learn. Recently, I started dabbling in Jekyll and <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" target="_blank">Liquid</a> to build static sites. This site uses both and is hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
