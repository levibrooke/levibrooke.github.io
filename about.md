        <p>My name is Levi Porter and I'm a digital strategist and front-end web designer and developer. I have been working in marketing - mostly as a freelancer - for a couple years. I've always had an interest in how things are made but it's only recently that I decided to learn how to build websites.</p>
        <p>Last year, I traded in the palm trees and sunshine of Florida for the palm trees and sunshine of Hawaii. When I'm not working, I like to play soccer and listen to podcasts. I also have a pretty serious Spotify addiction and you can check out <a>what I'm listening to</a>.</p>
